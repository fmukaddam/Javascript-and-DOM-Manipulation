# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Background
WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.<br>

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.<br>

That's why we are hiring you. We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.<br>

# Steps to build the code
1) Created a HTML web page where the data will be presented <br>

2) Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, and wrote out a code that appends the table and presents it on web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
